# custom isat dialogue maker

![cover image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf32fc8e-7571-4c88-ba09-1fd1eaed5de7)

an app made in godot that allows you to make custom dialogue images mimicking [insertdisc5](https://insertdisc5.com)'s game [In Stars and Time](https://instarsandtime.come)!

inspired by [kongkrog](https://github.com/kongkrog)'s [isat profile customizer](https://kongkrog.github.io/isat-profile-customizer), which you should also check out because it's cool and has different features

# features

it's a bit finnicky and not at all perfect but hey it's fun

- the basics: write a thing and put an image there and the character says the thing. woah
- adjust how much the portrait is horizontally offset
- adjust the height of the dialogue box
- export as a transparent png (and optionally trim transparency)
- layers!!! allows you to stack multiple images on top of each other, so you can do something like have the body and face separate
- show and hide the <abbr title="click-to-continue">CTC</abbr> arrow
- switch the font between VCR OSD MONO and BestTen-CRT (used in the english and japanese translations of the game respectively)
- format text with bbcode

# notes and tips

- all of the canon characters' portrait offsets are a bit different. no i don't know why it's like that it just Is. it's not *that* important, kongkrog's tool does 0.2 for all of them, but i went ahead and figured out what's closest for all the canon characters:
  - siffrin, mirabelle, isabeau, odile, bonnie: 0.18
  - loop, king: 0.22
  - euphrasie: 0.26
